🏗 Project Overview

This project simulates a realistic shopping mall using legacy OpenGL. The mall consists of two floors, each containing two distinct shops. The first floor includes a clothing and bag store with a fitting room, and a beverage shop offering various drinks with seating areas. Access between floors is provided via a staircase and a functional elevator. The second floor features a fast-food restaurant and a canned goods store. Surrounding the mall is a manually crafted outdoor environment with multiple buildings, adding depth and realism to the scene. Approximately 90% of the models were created from scratch, with only 10% relying on pre-built assets. The simulation also includes ambient sound effects and a controllable camera for immersive navigation.
